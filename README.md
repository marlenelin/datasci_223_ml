## Name:
Marlene Lin 

## About me: 
I am a first year health data science master's student, currently working as a teaching assistant for the UCSF Library Data Sciences and Open Scholarship team. I am also working on an info commons based project on diabetes screening for Dr. Fukuoka, and an early onset Alzheirmer's Disease subtyping project for Dr. La Joie. My career goal at the moment is to work as a research data analyst. 

## My portfolio/website: 
https://linnil.vercel.app/ 

I built this using notion and host it on vercel but have not updated it in a while. I would appreciate any addition/advice on the site while taking this course. I was having trouble with images and other multimedia on notion, so my approach was pretty much using notion as a catalogue, then for individual items I publish them using quarto + git.

## About DataSci 223:
I have been using python, R, and SQL in my research quite extensively, but some topics are new to me, like Experimentation & A/B Testing, Large Language Models, Generative AIs, and Time Series Analysis, and I am defintely interested in gaining literacies in these topics.
